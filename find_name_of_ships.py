"""This fill search for the names of ships

To find the corresponding names, only the mmsi is required. The programm will
automatically find the corresponding names in the database if it exists.
Otherwise an error will be printed.
In a future version it might be possible to look for the best matches (i.e.
assuming there was a small mistake in the mmsi name and looking for the best
correspondance)
