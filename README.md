# Projet Entreprise (S3-IMTA)


This repository was forked from pirpyn/pyAISm repository (https://github.com/pirpyn/pyAISm). 

This repository has educational purposes and it's related to Cerema (https://www.cerema.fr/fr) and the IMT Atlantique (https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr). 

We are a group of 5 students from the Frech Grande-Ã‰cole IMT Atlantique. Our goal, in collaboration with Cerema, is to develop a processing chain integrating AIS data and a ship database able to detect rendezvous (RDV) between AIS equipped vessels.

We want to thank aayaffe (https://github.com/aayaffe) and pirpyn (https://github.com/pirpyn) for the AIS messages decoder.

## pyAISM (from https://github.com/pirpyn/pyAISm)


A small and incomplete python decoder for AIS messaging.

How to use pyAISm and more information can be found in their repository (https://github.com/pirpyn/pyAISm)
